# Mean
# The mean is the average value of all the values in a dataset.
# To calculate the mean value of a dataset,
# we first need to find the sum of all the values and then divide the sum of all the values by the total number of values

# This is a list of numbers that we will use to calculate the mean
list1 = [12, 16, 20, 20, 12, 30, 25, 23, 24, 20]

# This variable will hold the sum() of all the numbers in the list and divide it by the number of numbers in the list using the len() function
mean = sum(list1) / len(list1)


print(mean)
